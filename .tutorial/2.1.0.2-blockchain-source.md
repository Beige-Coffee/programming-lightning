# Fetching Blockchain Data

Regardless of how your Lightning node retrieves data from the Bitcoin blockchain (ex: Bitcoin Core, Esplora, Electrum, etc.), it's going to need to be notified when new block are found. This way, it can scan new blocks to ensure that our counterparty is not attempting to cheat us by publishing an old channel-state.

Below is a diagram depicting a few imporant data types that our node will need to be able to retrieve from the Bitcoin blockchain.

1) Block Height
2) Block Data (Header + Transactions)
3) Block Hash

## Updating Our BitcoinClient

Broadly speaking, all of the functionality that we add to our Lightning node will fall into one of two categories:
1) Required by LDK.
2) Not required by LDK, but necessary for our Lightning application.

Remember, LDK is meant to be a highly-modular software development kit. Developers can customize components such:
- Where they source blockchain data from (Bitcoin Core, Esplora, etc.)
- Where their on-chain wallet resides (Integrated BDK wallet, Bitcoin Core, etc.)
- How to persist data (File system, database, etc.)
- ..... and so much more!

To enable this flexibility, LDK provides **interfaces** that developers will need implement. These interfaces, called "traits" in Rust, defines a set of methods that an interface must implement. Think of this as LDK informing the developer what needs to be "plugged in" for LDK to work properly. 

#### Let's learn by example!

## BlockSource

As we mentioned above, a Lightning Node needs to be able to retrieve blockchain data regardles of what the chain source is. Therefore, LDK has a provided a `BlockSouce` interface, which defines methods to retrieve block and header data from a blockchain source. The developer is in charge of implementing these functions in whatever manner best suits their application's needs.

The `BlockSource` interface, with its required methods, can be seen below. As you can see, LDK is essentially informing the developer that an LDK lightning node ***must*** provide functions to retrieve **header data**, **block data**, and the best **block's hash**. These functions will be called privately within LDK as part of our node's normal operations, but we must define them first.

```rust
pub trait BlockSource: Sync + Send {
    fn get_header<'a>(
        &'a self,
        header_hash: &'a BlockHash,
        height_hint: Option<u32>,
    ) -> AsyncBlockSourceResult<'a, BlockHeaderData>;

    fn get_block<'a>(
        &'a self,
        header_hash: &'a BlockHash,
    ) -> AsyncBlockSourceResult<'a, BlockData>;

    fn get_best_block<'a>(
        &'a self,
    ) -> AsyncBlockSourceResult<'_, (BlockHash, Option<u32>)>;
}
```

Since our Lightning node is retrieving blockchain data from Bitcoin Core, we'll complete these functions by fetching and returning the required data by querying Bitcoin Core's JSON RPC interface. This is the same interface we’ve been using with commands like `bcli getbestblockhash`, but now we’ll call it programmatically from our Rust code.

To keep things organized, we’ll encapsulate the `BlockSource` functionality inside our `BitcoinClient` struct. This way, all interactions with Bitcoin Core (fetching blocks, broadcasting transactions, etc.) live in one place.

In Rust, we define these behaviors using the `impl` keyword, which lets us attach methods to our `BitcoinClient`. 

```rust
impl BlockSource for BitcoinClient {
    fn get_header(header_hash: BlockHash, height_hint: Option<u32>) {
        // implement here
    }

    fn get_block(header_hash: BlockHash) {
        // implement here
    }

    fn get_best_block() {
        // implement here
    }
}
```

One this is completed, these functions will be available within the `BitcoinClient` structure. So, for example, you could obtain the best block's chain hash using:

```rust
let bitcoin_rpc_client = BitcoinClient::new(host, port, rpc_user, rpc_password, network).await.unwrap();
let best_block = bitcoin_rpc_client.get_best_block();
```


## ⚡️ Implement `BlockSource` For Our `BitcoinClient`
Complete the implementation of `BlockSource` for `BitcoinClient` in `src/ch2_setup/bitcoin_client.rs`. You'll need to implement:

1. `get_header`: Fetches a block header by its hash
2. `get_block`: Fetches a complete block by its hash
3. `get_best_block`: Fetches information about the most recent block

```rust
impl BlockSource for BitcoinClient {
    fn get_header<'a>(
        &'a self, header_hash: &'a BlockHash, height_hint: Option<u32>,
    ) -> AsyncBlockSourceResult<'a, BlockHeaderData> {
        Box::pin(async move { 
            self.bitcoind_rpc_client.get_header(header_hash, height_hint).await
        })
    }

    fn get_block<'a>(
        &'a self, header_hash: &'a BlockHash,
    ) -> AsyncBlockSourceResult<'a, BlockData> {
        Box::pin(async move {
            // your code here
        })
    }

    fn get_best_block(&self) -> AsyncBlockSourceResult<(BlockHash, Option<u32>)> {
        Box::pin(async move { 
            // your code here
        })
    }
}
```

### Available Methods

Remember, `self.bitcoind_rpc_client` is an `RpcClient`, so it provides some RPC methods that we can utilize:
- `get_header(header_hash, height_hint)` - Returns block header data
- `get_block(header_hash)` - Returns full block data
- `get_best_block()` - Returns the latest block info

Note, the first method, `get_header` had been provided for you. You can use this to guide your completion of the rest of the methods. Also, you'll notice that the following code has been provided for you within each function:

```rust
Box::pin(async move { 
    // your code here
})
```
This is included because our function is asynchronous, and at compile time, we don’t know the size of the data it will eventually return. To handle this, we **“box”** the future to give it a fixed size and **“pin”** it in on the heap to ensure its memory location remains stable.

While understanding this concept is important for asynchronous programming in Rust, it’s not essential for completing this workshop. Therefore, this code has been provided for you.

## Adding Additional Methods To `BitcoinClient`

If you recall from above, we mentioned that all of the functionality we implement will fall into one of two categories:
1) Required by LDK.
2) Not required by LDK, but necessary for our Lightning application.

The `BlockSource` functionality is required by LDK. However, we'll need to implement other functionality for our Lightning node that LDK may not explicity require. For example, when creating funding transaction for a Lightning channel, we'll need to fetch a UTXO to use as an input. LDK doesn't have a UTXO interface that needs to be implemented. Instead, it leaves that to us.

Since we're using Bitcoin Core for our on-chain wallet, let's add the ability to fetch UTXOs to our `BitcoinClient`. To get a feel for what we're going to need to implement, go ahead and execute the below command in your **shell**.

```
bcli listunspent
```

You should see something that looks like this...

```

    "txid": "1dded8de028fcbe91ea4373e15b0096509662326825db3a3f591961e2b5118a4",

## ⚡️ Implement `list_unspent` For Our `BitcoinClient`

For this exercise, we'll implement `list_unspent` for our `BitcoinClient`. To do this, we'll use another `impl` block in our Rust codebase, though, in reality, this would have likely been added underneath the `new` constructor we created previously.

To help with this exercise, another RPC method, `get_blockchain_info`, has been provided for you. These methods utilize the `call_method` available within our `self.bitcoind_rpc_client`, executing whichever command we pass in - along with any arguments we supply. In this case, `get_blockchain_info` makes and an RPC call to get blockchain info, passing in an empty vec, which indicates we are *not* providing any additional arguments.

Try to implement `list_unspent`. Note: you'll have to cast the response to a `ListUnspentResponse` type. For guidance on how to do this, check our `get_blockchain_info`. In this function, we cast the `getblockchaininfo` RPC call to a `BlockchainInfo` struct by specifying it in between `call_method::` and the method we are calling.

```rust
impl BitcoinClient {
    pub async fn get_blockchain_info(&self) -> BlockchainInfo {
        self.bitcoind_rpc_client
            .call_method::<BlockchainInfo>("getblockchaininfo", &vec![])
            .await
            .unwrap()
    }
    
    pub async fn list_unspent(&self) -> ListUnspentResponse {
        // implement here
    }
}
```

Just in case you're curious, the `ListUnspentResponse` is a custom type that wraps a `ListUnspentUtxo` struct, which you can see defined below.

This essentially formats the JSON response that we recieve from the `listunspent` RPC call we're making into a Rust type that we can use within our program.

```rust
pub struct ListUnspentUtxo {
    pub txid: Txid,
    pub vout: u32,
    pub amount: u64,
    pub address: Address,
}

pub struct ListUnspentResponse(pub Vec<ListUnspentUtxo>);

impl TryInto<ListUnspentResponse> for JsonResponse {
    type Error = std::io::Error;
    fn try_into(self) -> Result<ListUnspentResponse, Self::Error> {
        let utxos = self
            .0
            .as_array()
            .unwrap()
            .iter()
            .map(|utxo| ListUnspentUtxo {
                txid: Txid::from_str(&utxo["txid"].as_str().unwrap().to_string()).unwrap(),
                vout: utxo["vout"].as_u64().unwrap() as u32,
                amount: bitcoin::Amount::from_btc(utxo["amount"].as_f64().unwrap())
                    .unwrap()
                    .to_sat(),
                address: Address::from_str(&utxo["address"].as_str().unwrap().to_string())
                    .unwrap()
                    .assume_checked(), // the expected network is not known at this point
            })
            .collect();
        Ok(ListUnspentResponse(utxos))
    }
}
```
