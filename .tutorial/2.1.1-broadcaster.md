# Broadcasting Transactions To Chain

At this point, we've implemented the functionality to retrieve information from the Bitcoin blockchain. However, we still don't have a way to broadcast new transactions to the network. Without that capability, we'll have a pretty hard time opening Lightning channels!

## BroadcasterInterface
As we discussed previously, LDK provides interfaces which define methods that need to be implemented by the developer. `BroadcasterInterface` is one such interface, and it provides one method, `broadcast_transactions`. Here, again, we see the modularity and customizability of LDK. The developer can implement their preferred method for broadcasting transactions, and LDK will leverage that internally whenever it needs to broadcast a transaction for us.

For this workshop, we'll configure LDK to broadcast transactions using Bitcoin Core's `sendrawtransaction` method. If a developer did not have access to Bitcoin Core, they could use Esplora's [POST /tx](https://github.com/blockstream/esplora/blob/master/API.md#post-tx) endpoint instead.

```rust
pub trait BroadcasterInterface {
    // Required method
    fn broadcast_transactions(&self, txs: &[&Transaction]);
}
```

The `broadcast_transactions` method takes one or more `Transaction` types and broadcasts them to the chain. We saw the `Transaction` structure earlier in this workshop, but, as a reminder, this is what it looks like.

```rust
pub struct Transaction {
    pub version: Version,
    pub lock_time: LockTime,
    pub input: Vec<TxIn>,
    pub output: Vec<TxOut>,
}
```

## ⚡️ Implement `BroadcasterInterface` On Our `BitcoinClient`
To enable our Lightning node to broadcast transactions, we need to implement the `BroadcasterInterface` trait. Since we’ve already defined a `BitcoinClient` structure to manage our RPC connection to Bitcoin Core, we’ll extend its functionality by implementing the `BroadcasterInterface` trait for it.

We can do that by using the below syntax:

```rust
impl BroadcasterInterface for BitcoindClient {
    fn broadcast_transactions(&self, txs: &[&Transaction]) {
        // loop over transactions
            // convert Transaction to hex
            // send raw transaction
}
```

### Hints & Helpful Information

#### For Loops
For this exercise, you will need to iterate over the array of `Transaction`s and broadcast each one. To iterate over an array in Rust, you can use the following syntax:

```rust
for num in arr {
  println!("{num}"); 
}
```
#### sendrawtransaction Helper Function
Additionally, the below helper function has been provided to you. As you can see, it takes a transaction, represented as a hexadecimal string, converts it to JSON, and passes it as a parameter to the method `sendrawtransaction`. Since each broadcast will spawn an asyncronous process and we don't want to wait for the result before broadcasting the next transaction, we will execute the broadcast like this...
```rust
self.handle.spawn(async move {
    // async process goes here
})
```

These complexities have been removed from the exercise, but you're welcome to try implementing `broadcast_transactions` without using this helper function, if you would like.
```rust
impl BitcoindClientExercise {
    fn sendrawtransaction(&self, tx_hex: String) {
        let bitcoind_rpc_client = self.bitcoind_rpc_client.clone();
        self.handle.spawn(async move {
            let tx_json = serde_json::json!(tx_hex);
    
            if let Err(e) = bitcoind_rpc_client
                .call_method::<serde_json::Value>("sendrawtransaction", &[tx_json])
                .await
            {
                eprintln!("Failed to broadcast transaction: {}", e);
            } else {
                println!("Successfully broadcasted transaction: {}", tx_hex);
            }
        });
    }
}
```
