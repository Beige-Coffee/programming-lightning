# Broadcasting Transactions To Chain

At this point, we've implemented the functionality to retrieve information from the Bitcoin blockchain. However, we still don't have a way to broadcast new transactions to the network. Without that capability, we'll have a pretty hard time opening Lightning channels!

Let's fix that now!

## BroadcasterInterface
As we discussed previously, LDK provides a `BroadcasterInterface` interface trait that, once implemented, will broadcast transactions on our behalf. [You can read more about it here.](https://docs.rs/lightning/0.0.125/lightning/chain/chaininterface/trait.BroadcasterInterface.html)

The `BroadcasterInterface` has one required method, `broadcast_transactions`, which we will need to complete. 

```rust
pub trait BroadcasterInterface {
    // Required method
    fn broadcast_transactions(&self, txs: &[&Transaction]);
}
```

The `broadcast_transactions` method takes one or more `Transaction` and broadcasts them to the chain. We saw the `Transaction` structure earlier in this workshop, but, as a reminder, this is what it looks like.

```rust
pub struct Transaction {
    pub version: Version,
    pub lock_time: LockTime,
    pub input: Vec<TxIn>,
    pub output: Vec<TxOut>,
}
```

## ⚡️ Implement `BroadcasterInterface` On Our `BitcoindClient`
To enable our Lightning node to broadcast transactions, we need to implement the `BroadcasterInterface` trait. Since we’ve already defined a `BitcoindClient` structure to manage our RPC connection to Bitcoin Core, we’ll extend its functionality by implementing the `BroadcasterInterface` trait for it. This integration ensures that BitcoindClient becomes the central hub for broadcasting transactions, alongside its other responsibilities.

We can do that by using the below syntax:

```rust
impl BroadcasterInterface for BitcoindClient {
    fn broadcast_transactions(&self, txs: &[&Transaction]) {
        // implementation code goes here
}
```

For this exercise, try to complete `fn broadcast_transactions` in the `src/ch2_setup/exercises.rs`.
