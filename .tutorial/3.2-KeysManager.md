# Build A Key Manager

So, now that we have an idea of how a Lightning off-chain wallet might be structured, let's create a structure to hold these keys. Once created, we can add additional functions to conduct signing operations with the respective keys.

For this exercise, we'll create a `SimpleKeysManager` struct which will contain the following fields:

```rust
pub struct SimpleKeysManager {
    pub secp_ctx: Secp256k1<secp256k1::All>,
    pub node_secret: SecretKey,
    pub node_id: PublicKey,
    pub unilateral_close_pubkey: PublicKey,
    pub coop_close_pubkey: PublicKey,
    pub channel_master_key: Xpriv,
    pub inbound_payment_key: SecretKey,
    pub channel_child_index: AtomicUsize,
    pub seed: [u8; 32],
}
```

To complete this exercise correctly, you'll need to create keys that have the same derrivation paths as the keys in LDK. As a reminder, you can find the derivation paths in the image below. We won't be implementing the keys that are shaded out, such as the channel-specific keys.

</p>


Additionally, you will need to implement the right type of key (ex: extended private key, private key, public key, extended public key). The correct expected types can be seen in the `SimpleKeysManager` structure definition above.

## ⚡️ Implement the new constructor For Our SimpleKeysManager

Head over to your exercises file, and let's implement the `new` constructor. Recall, a constructor is similar to a method, in that they're both functions, but a constructor is a special funtion that initializes a new instance of a type. This will take a 32-byte seed as in input and return a `SimpleKeysManager` strucure that meets the above requirement types for each component.

```rust
impl SimpleKeysManager {
    pub(crate) fn new(seed: [u8; 32]) -> SimpleKeysManager {

    }
}
```

#### To help you with completing this excercise, the following functions are available to you:

```rust
fn get_master_key(seed: [u8; 32]) -> Xpriv {
  // create master key from seed
}
```

```rust
fn get_hardened_child_private_key(master_key: Xpriv, idx: u32) -> SecretKey {
  // create hardened child private key from given master key and index
}
```

```rust
fn get_hardened_extended_child_private_key(master_key: Xpriv, idx: u32) -> Xpriv {
  // create hardened extended child private key from given master key and index
}
```

```rust
fn get_public_key(private_key: SecretKey) -> Secp256k1PublicKey {
  // create public key from private key
}
```

Try implementing the following:

```rust
pub fn new_simple_key_manager(seed: [u8; 32]) -> SimpleKeysManager{

    // create master key

    // derive node secret

    // derive node id

    // derive shutdown private key

    // derive shutdown public key

    // derive channel extended private key

    // populate and return SimpleKeysManager
    SimpleKeysManager {
        secp_ctx: //,
        node_secret: //,
        node_id: //,
        unilateral_close_pubkey: //,
        coop_close_pubkey: //,
        channel_master_key: //,
        inbound_payment_key: //,
        channel_child_index: //,
        seed: //,
    }
  ```

## ⚡️ Sign Gossip Message

Now that we have a sturcture to manage our Lightning node's keys, we can begin to build out functionality to operate on the Lightning network and perform operations that will utilize these keys.

For example, one such operation is signing our gossip messages. Gossip messages are described in [BOLT #7: P2P Node and Channel Discovery](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/master/07-routing-gossip.md) and describe the process of communicating with other nodes on the Lightning network to convey information such as channel opens and channel updates.

We're able to do this because each public node on the Lightning network has a public and private key pair that is used to identify their nodes and sign things such as gossip messages and invoices - enabling us to verify the authenticity of the message. For our `SimpleKeysManager`, these are the keys derived from the hardened derivation path `m/0'`.

For this exercise, we'll create a function within our `SimpleKeysManager` struct that will sign gossip messages for us. the function will take a `msg` (ex: node announcment) as an input and return the signature. 

Let's take this opportunity to get a little more familiar with BOLTs. As we discussed earlier, BOLT specifications define how the Lightning network operates. While BOLTs varry slightly in structure, they generally follow the following pattern:
- **Description**: An overview of the feature, message, or process being described. For example, the `node_announcement` message.
- **Requirements**: Specify the MUST, SHOULD, and MAY conditions that implementations must follow for compliance with the protocol. This can be confusing, but it helps ensure that all Lightning implementations behave the same. Fun fact, MUST, SHOULD, and MAY is actually [RFC 2119 terminology](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt), which was developed at Harvard Univer
- **Rational**: Explains why certain choices were made and provides historical context.

[Here](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/master/07-routing-gossip.md#requirements-2) is the link to the **Requirements** section for the `node_announcement` message. The second bullet point should describe how to produce a signature for this message and which key to use. Go ahead and see if you can implement the below function by following this guide.

<details>
  <summary>If you're having trouble finding the bullet point, click here</summary>

- MUST set `signature` to the signature of the double-SHA256 of the entire remaining packet after `signature` (using the key given by `node_id`).

</details>

```rust
pub fn sign_gossip_message(&self, msg: &[u8]) -> Signature {
    // calculate the 
    let double_sha256_hash = Sha256dHash::hash(msg);
    let msg_hash = hash_to_message(double_sha256_hash);
    self.secp_ctx.sign_ecdsa(&msg_hash, &self.node_secret)
}
```

#### Hints
Some helpful hints and helper functions are provided below:
1) The above message is signing a mssage per the requirements. So you will have to implement the right hash function.
2) You can take the double SHA256 hash of a message using the following syntax: `Sha256dHash::hash(msg)`.


# LDK Key Management Interfaces

So, we've just implemented a `SimpleKeysManager`, but, as you can see, it would be quite a lof of work to implement all of the functionality to sign gossip messages, invoices, transactions, etc.

To assist with this, LDK provides a simple default `KeysManager` implementation for handing cryptographic operations at both the node-level (ex: signing gossip messages) and the channel-level (ex: generating child keys for each Lightning channel and signing commitment transactions). The `KeysManager` can be initialized with a 32-byte seed, which is used as a BIP 32 extended key.

For those who wish to implement their own Key Management, the below LDK traits are available to you. Note that the `KeysManager` interface will implement these traits for you by default.

- `NodeSigner`: Handles node-level operations such as signing gossip messages/invoices and generating shared secrets for encrypting onion messages.
- `SignerProvider`: Creates channel-specific signers and derives channel-specific keys. 
- `EntropySource`: Provides cryptographically secure random numbers for signatures and key generation. Developers who wish to implement their own random number generator algorithms or other customizations can implement the `EntropySource` trait themselves.
