# Pay-to-Witness-Script-Hash (P2WSH)

Okay, we've reviewed a **Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash** and **Pay-to-Witness-Public-Key-Hash** script. Those were relatively simlple and easy to understand. Do we really need to make things more complicated? Of course we do! While **P2PKH** is sufficient to send bitcoin to someone else, it doesn't allow us to create more complex spending conditions, which are ultimately needed to build additional functionality on Bitcoin. Let's discuss the slightly more complicated, yet flexible, script: **Pay-to-Witness-Script-Hash** (**P2WSH**).

In a **P2WSH** transaction, bitcoin is "locked" to the hash of a script, as opposed to the hash of public key. The script specifies the conditions that must be met to spend the bitcoin later on. To unlock the bitcoin, the spender must provide:
- The original (unhashed) **Redeem Script** that, when hashed, matches the hash of our original redeem script.
- Any other data that the redeem script specfies, such as a valid **signature**, **preimage**, etc.)

#### What benefits do we obtain by locking to the hash of a script?

  <summary>Answer</summary>

By locking the bitcoin to the hash of a script, we obtain a few benefits:

1) **Flexibility**: While P2PKH is limited to locking Bitcoin to a single public key, **P2WSH** allows for the bitcoin to be locked to more complex conditions, such as requiring multiple signatures to spend the funds (also known as "Multisig"). As we'll see when we dig into the Lightning Network, a variation of **P2WSH** can be used to lock bitcoin to the hash of a secret message, called a "preimage". Therefore, to spend the funds, you must prove that you know the original secret that produced the hash.
2) **Security**: As we discussed earlier, Bitcoin transactions are publicly viewable on the blockchain. By locking the Bitcoin to a hash of a script, the spending conditions of the script are not viewable until the funds are spent later on.

## Locking To Multisig
To build our intuition of a **P2WSH** script, let's walk through an example where we'd like to lock our funds such that multiple keys are required to spend those funds. This is a very popular use of **P2WSH** transactions.

For this example, we'll lock our bitcoin such that 2 of 2 signatures must be presented to spend the funds.

```
 2 <pubkey1> <pubkey2> 2 OP_CHECKMULTISIG 
```
Let's build a function that takes in two Bitcoin public keys and returns a Script. In this case, this script will be our **Witness Script**, and it will only be presented when we unlock these bitcoin in the future. However, since we are locking these bitcoin to the hash of this script, we need to create it now.

### ⚡️ Build 2-of-2 Multisig Redeem Script

Can you write the implementation for a function that takes in two Bitcoin PublicKeys and generates a 2-of-2 multisig redeem script? 
```rust
fn two_of_two_multisig_redeem_script(pubkey1: &PublicKey, pubkey2: &PublicKey) -> Script {}
```
