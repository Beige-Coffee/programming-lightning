# Developing Our Penalty Mechanism

## Asymmetric Commitment Transactions 
Up until now, there is a pretty important detail that has been abstracted away from our commitment transactions. While you're probably itching to dig into advanced cryptography and punish some cheaters, it will make our lives much easier if we review this detail first.

In the actual Lightning Network, each party has their own version of ***each*** commitment transaction. They are mirror images of each other, but their output scripts are slightly different.

In the below example, you can see that both Alice and Bob's versions reflect the same distribution of funds, however, Alice's transaction provides a spending path for Bob to claim her funds if she attempts to cheat Bob - and vice versa.

***NOTE***: The Lightning Network fairness protocol is setup up in such a way that **you protect your counterparty** from ***you*** cheating. This is why the output that has ***your*** balance contains the penalty mechanism, while the output with your counterparty's balance is a simple **P2WPKH**. Put simply, if you cheat, your opponent can steal ***your*** output immediately.

## Introducing Revocation Keys

Okay, now that we've reviewed asymmetric transactions, hopefully the penalty mechanism will seem more intuitive.

To bring our penalty mechanism to life, we'll start by adding a new public key to our output script. This public key will be called the **revocation public key**, and it's a very special public key for the following reasons:
1) It's created by combining **one public key from Alice** and **one public key from Bob**.
2) At the time of creating the public key, ***neither Alice nor Bob know the private key for either public key***.

**However**, when Alice and Bob decide to move to a new channel state, they will exchange the key material needed for **each other** to calculate the ***other person's private key***. Neither will be able to calculate the private key ***for their own revocation public key***. 

This way, each party provides a way for the counterparty to claim their funds ***if and only if*** they attempt to publish an old transaction.

## ⚡️ Generate A Revocation Public Key
For this exercise, we'll generate a revocation public key that can be used in an output script to protect our counterparty against us cheating. This will get a little mathy, but don't worry! We'll step through it together. Below is the general equation for calculating a revocation public key.

- `R` is the remote party's revocation basepoint. If Alice is calcuating the revocation public key, then this will be Bob's revocation basepoint, which Bob gives to Alice when they set up the channel.
- `S` is Alice's per commitment point. Remember, this is a public key that is unique to every commitment transaction.
- `h1` is the SHA256 hash of both public keys. The `||` symbol means "concatenate". Therefore, to calculate `h1`, we serialize both keys, concatenate them together, and then take the hash of the result.
- `h2` is the SHA256 hash of both public keys, but in the opposite order as `h1`.

To help you with completing this excercise, the following functions are available to you:

```rust
pub fn pubkey_multiplication_tweak(pubkey1: PublicKey, sha_bytes: [u8; 32]) -> PublicKey {
  // convert sha256 output to scalar
  // "tweak" public key by multiplying it by the scalar
}
```

```rust
pub fn sha256_hash(key1: &PublicKey, key2: &PublicKey) -> [u8; 32] {
  // calculate the sha256 hash of two public keys
  // pubkey1 is added to stack first
  // pubkey2 is added to stack second
  // the shar256 of the combined pubkeys is returned 
}
```
Finally, note that you can add two public keys together by using the `.combine()` syntax. For example:
```rust
key1.combine(key2)
```

#### ⚡️ Write Function `generate_revocation_pubkey` To Generate A Revocation Public Key For Our Output Script
Try to complete the function `generate_revocation_pubkey` to calculate the revocation public key when given a counterparty's revocation basepoint and your own per commitment point. This function should return the revocation public key we need to include in our commitment transaction.
```rust
fn generate_revocation_pubkey(countersignatory_basepoint: &PublicKey, per_commitment_point: &PublicKey) -> PublicKey {
}
```

Try implementing the following:
- Calculate `h1` by obtaining the SHA256 of `R` and `P` concatenated.
- Calculate `h2` by obtaining the SHA256 of `P` and `R` concatenated.
- Multiply `R` by `h1`. Remember, `R` is a public key and `h1` is a SHA256 hash, which will be interpreted as a scalar to "tweak" the public key.
- Multiply `P` by `h2`. Remember, `P` is a public key and `h2` is a SHA256 hash, which will be interpreted as a scalar to "tweak" the public key.
- Add the result of the two multiplications above. This is effectively adding two public keys together.
