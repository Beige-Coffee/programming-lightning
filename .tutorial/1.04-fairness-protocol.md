# Fairness Protocol

Before digging into Bitcoin transactions and the Lightning protocol, it's important to review **fairness protocols**, as they are the underpinning of decentralized systems such as Bitcoin and Lightning.

## What Is A Fairness Protocol?
Put simply, a **fairness protocol** is a set of rules designed to ensure fair outcomes even when participants may not trust eachother. To achieve fair outcome, these fairness protocols leverage mechanisms like incentives and penalties, removing the need for a central authority. 

## An Example
For a simple example of a fairness protocol, let's introduce Alice, Bob, and their mom.

Alice and Bob are hungry for cake (who isn't), but they never play fair when cake is involved. They both try to take as much as they can!

</p>

To ensure there is a fair division of cake, we could try implementing one of the following:

1) **Law**: If you're caught eating more than half of the cake, you are grounded for 100 hours. Ouch!
2) **Trusted Third Parties**: Mom is in charge of splitting the cake and handing the relevant portions to Alice and Bob.
3) **Fairness Protocol**: ....

#### How can we design a fairness protocol such that Alice and Bob do not have to trust eachother but still get fair outcomes?

Mom can enforce a game, called **"cut and choose"**. In this game, one child plays the role of **"cutter"** and the other child plays the role of **"chooser"**.

The **"cutter"** will begin the game by splitting the cake into two pieces. The **"chooser"** will then select which piece of cake they want. If the **"cutter"** decides to cheat by creating a bigger pile of cookies, the **"chooser"** can punish them by taking the bigger pile. As long as both participants play by the rules, a fair outcome is incentivized by the protocol.

## The Lightning Network
Throughout this workshop, keep the concept of a fairness protocol in mind. Much of the Bitcoin wizardry that we are about to encounter is, at it's heart, a way of enforcing fair outcomes on the Lightning Network without requiring a trusted party.
