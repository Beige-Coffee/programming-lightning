# Fairness Protocol

Before digging into Bitcoin transactions and the Lightning protocol, it's important to review **fairness protocols**, as they are the underpinning of decentralized systems such as Bitcoin and Lightning.

## What Is A Fairness Protocol?
Simply put, a **fairness protocol** is a set of rules designed to ensure *fair outcomes* among participants without requiring mutual trust. These protocols use mechanisms such as incentives and penalties to enforce fairness, eliminating the need for a central authority.

You might be wondering: "How do we measure fairness?" That’s a great question—and one without a simple answer. Fairness isn’t something that can be fully defined in objective terms, like a GPS calculating the fastest route from point A to point B.

A more practical way to approach fairness is to ensure that participants can expect predictable and equitable outcomes based on predefined rules. If these expected outcomes are made explicit and participants agree to them when entering the system, then fairness can be objectively enforced within that framework.

When designing the rules for our fairness protocol, we will need to consider game theory and incentives of our participants. If we have a poor understanding of the participants motivations, we may design rules that are easily manipulated and undermine our ultimate objective.

## An Example
For a simple example of a fairness protocol, let's introduce Alice, Bob, and their mom.

Alice and Bob are hungry for cake (who isn't), but they never play fair when cake is involved. They both try to take as much as they can!

First, we'll define the **fair outcome** we'd like participants to be able to expect.
- **Outcome**: Alice and Bob should recieve equal amounts of cake.

To ensure there is a fair division of cake, we could implement one of the following:

1) **Law**: If you're caught eating more than half of the cake, you are grounded for 100 hours. Ouch!
2) **Trusted Third Parties**: Mom is in charge of splitting the cake and handing the relevant portions to Alice and Bob.
3) **Fairness Protocol**: ....

#### How can we design a fairness protocol such that Alice and Bob do not have to trust eachother but still get fair outcomes?

First, we must assume that Alice and Bob want to maximize the amount of cake they eat. If this is not a safe assumption, then the below fairness protocol would not work as well.

Assuming Alice and Bob both want to maximize the amount of cake they get, Mom can enforce a game, called **"cut and choose"**. In this game, one child plays the role of **"cutter"** and the other child plays the role of **"chooser"**.

The **"cutter"** will begin the game by splitting the cake into two pieces. The **"chooser"** will then select which piece of cake they want. If the **"cutter"** decides to cheat by creating a bigger pile of cookies, the **"chooser"** can punish them by taking the bigger pile. As long as both participants play by the rules, a fair outcome is incentivized by the protocol.

The protocol could break down slightly if our original incentive assumption was not correct. For example, imagine that Bob is on a diet and don't want to eat too much cake. Alice knows this, so she deliverately cuts the cake in 90%/10% pieces. The larger pieces will destroy Bob's diet, so he reluctantly chooses the smaller piece.

## The Lightning Network
Throughout this workshop, keep the concept of a fairness protocol in mind. Much of the Bitcoin wizardry that we are about to encounter is, at it's heart, a way of enforcing fair outcomes between multiple entities without requiring a trusted party.
