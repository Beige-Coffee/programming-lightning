# Timelocks

Timelocks are a neat feature in Bitcoin that will become **very** useful as we begin to build our super fast payment protocol, Lightning.

Timelocks allow us to lock bitcoin such that they can only be spent after a certain amount of time passes. For example, we can lock bitcoin so that they can only be spent after 144 blocks from when they are mined. Or, we can accidentally lock them  forever - fun!

## Relative & Absolute Timelocks
There are multiple ways to specify time-based conditions on our transactions. Generally speaking, timelocks can either be **relative** or **absolute**.
- A **relative** timelock will lock bitcoin until either a certain **number of blocks** or **seconds** have passed since the input or output is first mined in a block. For example, if I add a relative timlock of 144 blocks to an output, then that output is only spendable 144 blocks (~1 day) *after* it is first mined within a block.
- An **absolute** timelock will lock bitcoin until either a given **block height** or **unix timestamp** is reached. For example, if I timelock an output to block height 2,000,000, then the output cannot be spent until after block 2,000,000.

## Timelocks in Bitcoin Transactions
Timelock conditions can be placed in the following three locations within a transaction:
- **```nLocktime```**: This is a **transaction level** timelock that locks the entire transaction to an **absolute** timelock. If a timelock condition is placed in this field, then the transaction itself cannot be mined until **after** a specific block height or time has passed.

- **```nSequence```**: This is an **input level** timelock that locks an input to a **relative** timelock. If a timelock condition is placed on an input, then the input cannot be **mined** until that **amount of blocks or time has passed since the output it's referencing was mined**. Therefore, this input is only able to be mined after that time period has passed! It's also important to note that the ```nSquence``` field is used to enable `nLocktime` and **Replace-By-Fee**.

- **```scriptPubKey```**: Using the script programming language, you can lock **outputs** with both a **relative** and **absolute** timelock. This ensures that the outputs cannot be spent until either
  - A block height or timestamp has been reached.
  - A specified number of block or seconds have passed.

The **```nSequence```** field is quite important when configuring locktimes, so let's take a closer look at it.
- To enable **```nLocktime```** to be used on a transaction, we need to configure the **```nSequence```** for at least one input to be `0xFFFFFFFE` or less.
- To enable **Replace By Fee**, we need to configure the **```nSequence```** for at least one input to be `0xFFFFFFFD` or less.
- To enable **Relative Locktime**, we need to configure the **```nSequence```** to be:
  - **`0x00000000`** to **`0x0000FFFF`**
  - **`0x00400000`** to **`0x0040FFFF`**

## ⚡️ Generate a Timelocked Output

For this exercise, imagine you want to lock an **output** such that it cannot be spent until a certain number of blocks have **passed since the input it's spending from was mined**. Additionally, to unlock the output, the spender must provide the hash of the private key it's locked to.

If you're feeling brave, try to complete the `timelocked_p2pkh` function below without any hints. This function will take a ```PublicKey``` and ```height_or_timestamp``` as an input and produce an output script.


The above picture will be helpul in addition to the following **P2PKH** output script.

```
OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <pubkey_hash> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG`
```

```rust
fn timelocked_p2pkh(pubkey: &PublicKey, height_or_timestamp: i64) -> ScriptBuf {
}
```
