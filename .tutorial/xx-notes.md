For this workshop, we will build a **Simple Payment Verification (SPV)** client that will periodically poll our Replit's Regtest network for the best chain tip. The below diagram shows a very high-level view of what this architecure will look like. Since LDK is a modular software development kit, it's up to us to implement the actual connection to the Bitcoin blockchain. We can do this by completing the `BlockSource` trait with our chosen method (RPC, REST, etc.).
