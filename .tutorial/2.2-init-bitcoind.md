# Create New BitcoindClient Instance

Now that we've implemented the required functionality for `BlockSource` and connected it to Bitcoin Core via `RpcClient`, we can we can start building on this momentum by creating a constructor method to create a new `BitcoindClient` instance for our application. Once created, we'll be able to pass this instance to other LDK components that need to utilize block data for operations such as channel management.

## ⚡️ Implement the `new` constructor For Our `BitcoindClient`
For this exercise, we'll implement the `new` constructor so that we can create a new instance of our `BitcoindClient`, which we will pass to various LDK components later.

We'll also implement sanity check RPC call to Bitcoin Core as part of the initialization. This will ensure that, each time we create a new instance, we know it's successfully able to communicate with Bitcoin Core.

To do this, we'll have to complete the following steps:
1) **Define an HTTP Endpoint**
	- [HttpEndpoint Rust Docs](https://docs.rs/lightning-block-sync/latest/lightning_block_sync/http/struct.HttpEndpoint.html)
2) **Define RPC credentials**
	- Credentials should be a base64 encoding of a user name and password joined by a colon.
3) **Create a new RPC Client**
	- [RpcClient::new Rust Docs](https://docs.rs/lightning-block-sync/latest/lightning_block_sync/rpc/struct.RpcClient.html#method.new)
4) **Make test RPC call**
	- [RpcClient call_method Rust Docs](https://docs.rs/lightning-block-sync/latest/lightning_block_sync/rpc/struct.RpcClient.html#method.call_method)
5) **Return instance of Bitcoin Client**

If you're familiar with Rust, helpful documentation/hints have been provided below each step. If you're not very familiar with Rust, the below helper functions are available to you:


```rust
fn get_http_endpoint(host: &String, port: u16) -> HttpEndpoint {
	// creates HttpEndpoint object with given host and port
}
```

```rust
fn format_rpc_credentials(rpc_user: &String, rpc_password: &String) -> String {
	// creates rpc credentials string in required format
}
```

```rust
fn new_rpc_client(rpc_credentials: &String, http_endpoint: HttpEndpoint) -> RpcClient {
	// creates new rpc client
}
```

```rust
async fn test_rpc_call(bitcoind_rpc_client: &RpcClient) -> std::io::Result<BlockchainInfo> {
	// makes a test "getblockchaininfo" RPC call to Bitcoin Core
}
```
**You should be good-to-go! Try implementing the `new` constructor in ```src/ch2_setup/exercises.rs```**! Click `Run` at the top of the Replit when you're done to see if the test `test ch2_setup::test::test_new_bitcoind ...` passes.
```rust
impl BitcoindClient {
	pub(crate) async fn new(
		host: String, port: u16, rpc_user: String,
		rpc_password: String, network: Network,
	) -> std::io::Result<Self> {
		
		// define http endpoint

		// define rpc credentials 

		// create a new RpcClient

		// make an RPC call to Bitcoind to ensure our connection is working properly
		// raise error if we cannot connect

		// create instance of BitcoindClient
		
		// return BitcoindClient
	}
}
```
