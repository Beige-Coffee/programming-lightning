# Handling Events

At its core, Lightning is a decentralized payment system that relies on enforcing a fairness protocol. As such, parties that choose to engage with the Lightning protocol need to be able to **initiate** actions (ex: opening a channel, send a payment) and **react** to actions (ex: punish counterparty for cheating, routing incoming HTLC).

As you can imagine, our node will be initiating and reacting to many actions at once. To ensure that our node can do this in a safe and performant manner, LDK leverages an event-driven architecture. This provides a few benefits to the developer:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each LDK component (ex: `ChannelManager`, `ChainMonitor`, `PeerManager`) can focus on executing its responsibilities. If it needs to communicate with another component, such as a `ChainMonitor` informing a `ChannelManager` that an on-chain punishment transaction has been broadcasted and a channel should be closed, then the component can send an event to the intended recipient component and then continue with its core responsibilities.
- **Customized Architecture**: Event-driven architecture and separation of concerns allow for developers to further customize their lightning applications. For example, as we saw earlier, a developer can choose to deploy their `ChainMonitor` (or a replica of their `ChainMonitor`) on a different server than their main application. This provides additional assurance that, if their main application were to crash, they have a backup server that is focused on watching on-chain activity and responding appropriately. Therefore, when their application resumes operation, the `ChainMonitor`, hosted on another server, can simply send a notification event to the `ChannelManager` and inform them of any relevant activity.
- **Custom Business Logic**: By leveraging an event-driven architecture, LDK allows the user to add additional business logic before processing events. For example, when a new node is attempting to open a channel with you, your node will receive an `OpenChannelRequest`. You, the developer, can customize how you would like your node to react to this message. For example, perhaps there is some sort of reputation system that you have access to for public nodes, and you would like to check the reputation of the node before accepting. You can program this business logic within your application when handling this event.

## Setting Up An Event Handler

To set up an **Event Handler**, we'll need to define a function that can process a given event accordingly. To do this, we can define a funciion (for example, `handle_ldk_events`) that will take in a wide variet of components that we'll need access to. We'll then create a long `match` statement, which will take a given `event` and execute the logic that we've implemented within this function.

For example, the first event below is `FundingGenerationReady`, which signals to our node that we're ready to open a channel with a given counterparty, and the event wil be emitted with the information we need to create the funding transaction. We can use this information, along with our `bitcoind_client` input, to build the funding transaction, and then we will pass it to our `channel_manager` so that LDK can handle the channel open from here.

You can read the full of events [here](https://docs.rs/lightning/latest/lightning/events/enum.Event.html).


```rust
async fn handle_ldk_events(
  channel_manager: ChannelManager, bitcoind_client: BitcoindClient,
  network_graph: NetworkGraph, keys_manager: KeysManager,
  bump_tx_event_handler: BumpTxEventHandler, peer_manager: PeerManager,
  inbound_payments: InboundPaymentInfoStorage,
  outbound_payments: OutboundPaymentInfoStorage, fs_store: FilesystemStore,
  output_sweeper: OutputSweeperWrapper, network: Network, event: Event,
) {
  match event {
    Event::FundingGenerationReady {
        temporary_channel_id,
        counterparty_node_id,
        channel_value_satoshis,
        output_script,
        ..
      } => {
      // Construct the raw transaction with one output, that is paid the amount of the
      // channel.
      let addr = WitnessProgram::from_scriptpubkey(
        &output_script.as_bytes(),
        Network::Regtest,
      )
      .expect("Lightning funding tx should always be to a SegWit output")
      .to_address();
      
      let mut outputs = vec![HashMap::with_capacity(1)];
      outputs[0].insert(addr, channel_value_satoshis as f64 / 100_000_000.0);
      let raw_tx = bitcoind_client.create_raw_transaction(outputs).await;

      // Have your wallet put the inputs into the transaction such that the output is
      // satisfied.
      let funded_tx = bitcoind_client.fund_raw_transaction(raw_tx).await;

      // Sign the final funding transaction and give it to LDK, who will eventually broadcast it.
      let signed_tx = bitcoind_client.sign_raw_transaction_with_wallet(funded_tx.hex).await;

      let final_tx: Transaction =
        encode::deserialize(&hex_utils::to_vec(&signed_tx.hex).unwrap()).unwrap();
      
      // Give the funding transaction back to LDK for opening the channel.
      if channel_manager
        .funding_transaction_generated(temporary_channel_id, counterparty_node_id, final_tx)
        .is_err()
      {
        println!(
          "\nERROR: Channel went away before we could fund it. The peer disconnected or refused the channel.");
        print!("> ");
        std::io::stdout().flush().unwrap();
      }
    },
    Event::FundingTxBroadcastSafe { .. } => {},
    
    Event::PaymentClaimable { .. } => {},
    
    Event::OpenChannelRequest { .. } => {},
    
    Event::PendingHTLCsForwardable { .. } => {},

    Event::SpendableOutputs { .. } => {},

    Event::ChannelReady { .. } => {},

    Event::ChannelClosed { .. } => {},

  }
}
```

## Starting The Event Handler

Once we've configured our custom logic for handling LDK events, we'll need to start a **background processor**. The background processor will orchestate all of the components that we've created, glueing them together so that they can process events and communicate with each other. The **event handler** that we defined previously will be provided to the background processor as an input.

When processing events, LDK will first handle events itself, then it will pass those events on to our custom event handler for further processing. For example, when payments (or probes) succeed or fail, LDK updates its internal scorer so that it can better estimate the capcaity of any given channel and optimize future routing. These events (`PaymentPathSuccessful`, `PaymentPathFailed`, `ProbeSuccessful`, `ProbeFailed`) will be processed first by LDK via the background processor, and then they will be passed on to our custom handler for, if applicable, further processing.

Now, let's review the two ways that we can set up a background processor for our application.

### `BackgroundProcessor`
LDK provides a `lightning-background-processor` crate that provides utilities which take care of tasks that:
1) Need to happen periodically to keep your node running.
2) Can or should happen in the background.
