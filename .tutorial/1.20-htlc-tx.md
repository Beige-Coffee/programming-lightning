# HTLC & Transactions

Now that we've built our intuition around how HTLCs work, let's dive down to the transaction level to see how they are implemented. Imagine Alice is sending a 400,000 sat payment to Dianne through Bob and Charlie. Since Alice has a channel with Bob, Alice and Bob will begin by updating their respective commitment transactions to include a new output for the HTLC.

As you probably expected by now, let's add another public key for both Alice and Bob. These public keys will be used in the scripts for the HTLC output.

We'll look at the output scripts in on the next page, but, for now, we can note that much of the commitment transaction is similar to the previous commitment transactions we've looked at. For example:
- The ```to_local``` output for Alice and Bob will still have two spending paths.
  - One spendable by the local node after ```to_self_delay``` blocks have passed.
  - The other spendable by the remote node if they have the revocation key.
- The ```to_remote``` output for Alice and Bob are still immediately spendable by the owner of those funds.

## HTLC Output
The HTLC output is going to be a little gnarly. In fact, it won't be the same for Alice and Bob. Instead, it will change depending on if you are ***offering*** the HTLC or if you are ***recieving*** the HTLC.
