# Why Lightning?

At this point, you're likely convinced that we need to scale Bitcoin if we want to achieve larger levels of adoption and build a global financial system. That said, you may be wondering "why Lightning"? That would be a great question!

A TLDR answer may be something as simple as: it works, and it's here. Many other scaling solutions are still in development, un-proven, or dependent on a Bitcoin soft-fork. On the other hand, via platforms like Cash App, Coinbase, Binance, OKX, and many more, over 650 million people have access to the Lightning network right now. [Insert data on $ and # of Lightning transactions routed per year].

While the above information is useful on contextualizing the addoption and usage of Lightning, it stil doesn't tell us why Lightning is a great scaling solution. To do that, we must first review what properties we would like the ideal scaling solution to have. Then, as we move through the rest of this course, we will be able to evaluate Lightning ourselves and see how it compares.

# What Does Off-Chain Mean?
Off-chain refers to the ability to move bitcoin into an alternative consensus mechanism that is not Bitcoin's native Unspent Transaction Set (UTXO Set). The UTXO Set is the "database" of all existing bitcoins, including information such as what the locking conditions are and what amount is locked to a given condition.

# Scaling Solutions Properties
When moving bitcoins to an off-chain scaling solution, there are a few properties that we can define to analyze the quality of different off-chain solutions

## Self-Custody
Bitcoin was invented to remove the middle-man from financial transactions. As such, a primary concern for all scaling solutions is that users remain in control of their bitcoins and are not dependent on a third-party or alternative mechanism to withdraw their coins back on-chain.

Lightning ranks quite high on this metric, as both channel parties hold the necessary keys to sign and create new commitment transactions, which represent state changes. Therefore, nobody can steal the funds of another user in Lightning. If a channel party attempts to do this, they risk being punished and losing all of their funds.

## Unilateral Exit
Another holy grail of off-chain scaling solutions is the ability to unilaterally exit. This means that, if a user decides they want to exit the system and move their resulting bitcoin balance back on-chain in the form of a UTXO, they don't need anyone else's permission.

Lightning, again, ranks very high here. Since both channel partners hold valid commitment transactions, either party can choose to exit Lightning and return to on-chain whenever they'd like, giving them unilateral control over their funds.

## Decentralization
Of course, an important property of a scaling solution is that it should be decentralized. Even if you can unilaterally exit, it wouldn't be ideal if you were dependent on one party or orgaization to route payments. If this was the case, they could ban you from using the scaling solution at will.

In Lightning, you are free to open a channel with anyone you wish. As of early 2025, there are over 11,000 Lightning nodes on the network, and many are more than willing to open a channel to you.
