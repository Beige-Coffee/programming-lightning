# Introduction to Hash-Time-Locked-Contracts (HTLCs)

## Starting With The End In Mind

Introducing the famous ***HTLC*** will get a little complicated! While it's nothing we can't handle, it will be helpful if we start with the end in mind.

Routing a payment across the Lightning network just means that the **channel balance distributions** will change for each channel, such that, when the payment is complete:
- The sender will have less Bitcoin on their side of the channel
- The receiver will have more Bitcoin on their side of the channel

The above is true for **all** nodes in the route. For example, imagine Alice routes 400,000 sats to Dianne through Bob. You can see the original channel balances and updated channel balances in the visual below. **Take a moment and verify the following**:
- The total amount of Bitcoin in the payment route has *not changed*. More specifically, Alice and Bob's channel has 5M sats in both Channel States, while Bob and Dianne have 4.5M.
- The channel balances are updated such that Alice now has 400,000 less sats than she had prior to the payment, while Dianne has 400,000 more. Bob's balance remains unchanged.

**NOTE**: In reality, Bob would have received a fee for "forwarding" the payment (i.e., letting Alice us his channel liquidity to pay Dianne). If Bob didn't recieve a fee, he would have no incentive to pay Dianne.

## Invoice
Let's build our intuition of Lightning payments by going through an example. Imagine Alice goes to the local coffee shop, which Dianne owns. She is interested in buying a double espresso with raw milk, since that's what the influencers on Twitter are recommending.

She asks Dianne to generate an **invoice** for her. This invoice will provide basic payment information, such as the product that Alice is buying, the cost, and how long this offer is valid for.

## Contracts
When we think of payments, we may think of simply sending money and getting something in return, but there is more going on here. Each payment is actually a **contract**. For instance, when Alice buys a coffee, she sets up the followinig informal agreement with the coffee shop:

**If Alice pays 5k sats, then the vendor will give her coffee. This offer is valid for 8 hours, as the vendor may change their prices tomorrow.**

## Contracts on Lightning
Since Alice does not have a channel open with Dianne, the coffee shop owner, Alice will create a payment contract with Bob instead, since Bob has a channel open with Dianne. This contract will have the following condition: **If Bob pays Dianne 5,000 sats, Alice will send Bob 5,050 sats**, effectively refunding him.

#### Question: Why is Alice sending 5,050 sats to Bob? Isn't the payment only for 5,000 sats?
<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

The 50 sats are fees paid to Bob! We'll discuss the nuances of fees later in this course, but, for now, it's important to note that Alice will have to pay fees to each hop along the payment route to incentivize the node to forward the payment. Otherwise, Bob has no real reason to adjust is liquidity between his channels with Alice and Bob.

#### Question: What could go wrong here?

  <summary>Answer</summary>

There are many issues with this payment construction. Below are a few major ones:

1) Bob has no guarentee that Alice will refund him. For example, if he sent Dianne 5,000 sats and Alice refused to refund him, he would lose 5,000 sats.
2) Similar to the above issue, Alice has no guarentee that Bob paid Dianne. He could attempt to lie to Alice and say he sent 5,000 sats when he did not. If Alice believes him and sends Bob 5,050 sats, she would lose those funds.

**How can we fix this**?

## Proof of Payment
What we really need is a mechanism to prove that Bob paid Dianne. For example, if Bob is able to recieve a *verifiable* **receipt** from Dianne after sending her 400k sats, then Alice can be assured that Bob actually paid Dianne.

#### Question: How can we use cryptography to create a verifiable receipt?
<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

To create a **proof of payment** mechanism, Dianne can generate a large, 256-bit random number (**Preimage**) and then take the SHA256 hash of it, which would be the **Preimage Hash**. For example, Dianne could generate the following:
- Preimage (Secret): `34523948796532148976321459876321459876321459876321459876321459871`
- Preimage Hash: `a7c4e9f2b5d1a8c6e3f0d7b9a4c2e5f8d1b6a9c3e0f7d4b2a5c8e1f9d6b3e0f4`

Dianne would then take the **Preimage Hash** and include it in the invoice that she gives Alice, but Dianne will keep the **Preimage** to herself for now!

  <img src="./tutorial_images/intro_to_htlc/preimage_invoice.png" alt="preimage_invoice" width="50%" height="auto">
</p>

Alice can now update the contract with Bob, requiring that Bob provide the **Preimage** in order to claim the 5,000 from Alice. Since the **Preimage** is only known by Dianne, Bob will set up a contract with Dianne with the same **Preimage Hash** that Alice gave him.

This ensures that Bob will only pay Dianne if she provides Bob with the **Preimage**, which is exactly what Bob needs to be able to claim the 5,050 from Alice.

Notice, in the below contract, we now track the the timeout period in terms of **block height**, as opposed to hours.

</p>

Together, the above components enable Alice to create a **Hash-Time-Locked-Contract** (**HTLC**), meaning that the contract is "locked" such that the reciever of the contract must provide the **Preimage** within a specific amount of blocks (time) to be able to claim the locked funds.

**Take a minute to think through how we can set up these contracts in Bitcoin. How will we represent them? When you're ready, head over to the next section to learn how to implement a simple HTLC!**
