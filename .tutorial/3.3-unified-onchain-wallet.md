# Integrated On-Chain and Off-Chain Wallet

LDK makes it simple to combine an on-chani and off-chain wallet within the same app, allowing for seemless integration of on-chain and off-chain

#### Question: What are the benefits of combining an on-chain and off-chain wallet into one unified wallet?

  <br/>

There are major benefits to combining an on-chain and off-chain wallet into one unified wallet. A few of them are listed below.

1) **Shared Key Management**: By leveraging HD wallets, we can create a hardened extended private key, which will act as the 32-bytes of entropy needed to initialize our LDK wallet. By leveraging this architecture, we only need to back up one seed to be able to fully restore our wallet. Also, it's important that our LDK derivation path is **hardened**. This will ensure that, if our LDK keys are compromised, it will not put our on-chain wallet at risk.
2) **Access On-Chain and Off-Chain Funds**: By having an integrated wallet, it's easier to access and utilize both on-chain and off-chain funds. In some situations, having access to on-chain funds is very beneficial to Lightning. For example, if you would like to bump the fee on a channel-close transaction, you will need to attach additional fees from an on-chain UTXO. Additionally, if your commitment transactions support anchor outputs, then you will need on-chain funds to attach those fees later.

## ⚡️ Build A Unified Wallet

Complete `unified_onchain_offchain_wallet` in `src/ch3_keys/exercises.rs`.

```rust
pub fn unified_onchain_offchain_wallet(seed: [u8; 32]) -> KeysManager {
}

```

This function will take the seed to a separate on-chain wallet and return an LDK `KeysManager` by calling the [`KeysManager::new` constructor](https://docs.rs/lightning/latest/lightning/sign/struct.KeysManager.html#method.new), which can be seen below.

```rust
pub fn new(
    seed: &[u8; 32],
    starting_time_secs: u64,
    starting_time_nanos: u32,
)
```

To ensure that our LDK wallet is separate from our on-chain wallet, we'll derive a hardened private key from `m/535` and use this as our starting entropy for our wallet. **Make sure to use `m/535` as your hardened path! Otherwise, your function won't pass the automated test in this workbook.**

### To help you with completing this excercise, the following functions are available to you:

```rust
fn get_master_key(seed: [u8; 32]) -> Xpriv {
  // create master key from seed
}
```

```rust
fn get_hardened_extended_child_private_key(master_key: Xpriv, idx: u32) -> Xpriv {
  // create hardened extended child private key from given master key and index
}
```

```rust
fn get_current_time() -> Duration {
  // return current time
}
```

### The following methods are available to you and will be helpful as you complete this exercise.

1. To access the bytes from a secret key, you can use the below method.
```rust
secret_key.private_key.secret_bytes();
```
2. To obtain the current time in seconds or subsecond nanos, you can use the following:
```rust
cur.as_secs()
cur.subsec_nanos()
```
