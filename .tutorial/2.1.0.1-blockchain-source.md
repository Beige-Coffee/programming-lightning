# Connecting To The Bitcoin Blockchain

Before we can get to complex Lightning Network functionality, let's begin by anchoring our node to the Bitcoin blockchain. After all, as we learned in the intro section, we'll start our Lightning journey by publishing a funding transaction in the Bitcoin blockchain.

As we just learned, the backbone of Lightning is a fairness protocol. Two parties agree to exchange bitcoin transactions off-chain, but transactions can be published to the chain if a given party needs to enforce the fairness protocol.

There are many answers to this question. Below are a few:
- Broadcasting transactions
  - Channel funding
  - Channel closing
  - Commitment / HTLCs
  - Justice (punishment)
- Monitoring blocks and transactions
  - Identify when funding transaction is mined (with ***x*** confirmations)
  - Spot if channel party attempts to publish an old state
- Fee Estimation
  - Via Bitcoin RPC `getmempoolinfo`

## Motivating Example

Let's start with a motivating example to help us really understand why a Lightning Node is to tightly integrated into the Bitcoin Blockchain **and** what functionality our node will need to be able to execute.

Take a look at the picture below. Imagine you're routing two HTLCs from the node (on the left) to Alice (on the right). For the advanced reader, these are simple Lightning commitment transactions - no anchor outputs. Now, imagine Alice goes offline, so you need to force-close this channel.

After looking at the below transaction, try answering the two questions below:
1) **How many outputs do we need to claim?**
2) **What is the minimum number of transactions you will need to publish on-chain to move *all* funds to outputs that you unilaterally control? You can assume a best-case scenario where neither channel partner is trying to attack your outputs.**

**Question 1: How many outputs do you need to claim?**
If we assume that we never recieved the preimages for these HTLCs, then we'd need to claim the following **six** outputs:
- The two `to_local` outputs for both commitment transactions.
- The two `HTLC` outputs on the commitment transaction between us and Node B. Remember, we're timing out these outputs and clawing back these funds.
- We'll claim the outputs on the two `HTLC` timeout transactions.

**Question 2: What is the minimum number of transactions you will need to publish on-chain to move *all* funds to outputs that you unilaterally control?**
If we assume that we never recieved the preimages for these HTLCs, then we'd to publish the following **four** transactions. Note: technically you may be able to consolidate the HTLC timeout transactions, but we'll assume they are not conolidated, which is what the diagram shows.
- The commitment transaction between us and Node A.
- The commitment transaction between us and Node B.
- The two `HTLC` timeout transactions.

Hopefully, the above example has provided an even deeper intuition as to how closely integrated our on-chain and off-chain capabilities will need to be!

## Lightning Node Blockchain Interfaces

As we saw in the motivating example above, a Lightning node will need to perform a variety of on-chain operations such as:
- Fetching Blockchain Data
- Broadcasting Transactions
- Estimating Fees

We'll cover these one-by-one in the next few sections, implementing helper functions and getting some help from LDK along the way.

## Connecting to Bitcoin

First, we'll need to decide how we're going to interact with the Bitcoin blockchain. There are a few different ways to do this, and LDK provides support for various architectural approaches. One approach is to run Bitcoin Core yourself and fetch data via an HTTP or RPC call to your node. If you completed the intro section of this workshop, you've already gotten some hands-on experience with this, as we published transactions and fetched blockchain data from the Bitcoin Core instance running in the background of this Repl via the command line. If you didn't complete the workshop (or, even if you did!), copy the below command and paste it in the **Shell**. This command is communicating with our Repl's Bitcoin Core instance and making an RPC call to get the latest block hash.

#### Our Repl's Bitcoin Core (Regtest)
```
bcli getbestblockhash
```

That said, fetching or broadcasting data via Bitcoin Core may not always be possible or preferred. For example, if you're running a node on a resource constrained machine, such as a mobile device, you may want to use an Esplora or Electrum server, which provide HTTP and RPC interfaces, respectively, to interact with Bitcoin. For a quick hands-on example of how an Esplora API would work, open up a new webpage and try typing the below into the search bar. This will call an Esplora endpoint, hosted by Blockstream, that returns the hash of the latest block.

#### Esplora API (Mainnet)
```
https://blockstream.info/api/blocks/tip/hash
```

Remember, our Repl is running our own Regtest network, but the Esplora API is fetching live data from Bitcoin Mainnet, so these block hashes will be different! For this workshop, we'll interface with Bitcoin via the Bitcoin Core instance that we have running in the background of our Repl.


### Defining Our Bitcoin Interface

Let's get to work! We'll start by defining a `struct` in Rust called `BitcoinClient`. In Rust, a struct is a custom data type that groups together related data and functionality - conceptually similar to a `class` in Python. Our `BitcoinClient` will act as the central hub for all interactions with Bitcoin Core. As we'll shortly see, it will implement specific functionality that LDK requires to run a Lightning node. This design keeps our code modular, maintainable, and aligned with LDK’s architecture.

<p align="center" style="width: 50%; max-width: 300px;">
  <img src="./tutorial_images/node_setup/bitcoinclient.png" alt="bitcoinclient" width="75%" height="auto">
</p>

If you open `ch2_setup/bitcoin_client.rs`, you'll see the `BitcoinClient` `struct` is defined for you. It will store important information that is relevant to our Bitcoin Core RPC connection. Most of the fields you see below should be familiar to you, but it's worth decribing two for additional clarity:
- `bitcoind_rpc_client`: This is an `RpcClient` type, which is an implementation of a Bitcoin Core RPC interface that has many useful methods for us.
- `handle`: This isn't that important to our workshop, but for the curious learner, the handle allows our `BitcoinClient` to spawn asyncronous tasks during it's normal operations. This is important, as Lightning nodes will handle many operations concurrently.

```rust
pub struct BitcoinClient {
    pub(crate) bitcoind_rpc_client: Arc<RpcClient>,
    network: Network,
    host: String,
    port: u16,
    rpc_user: String,
    rpc_password: String,
    pub handle: tokio::runtime::Handle,
}
```

</summary>
    
You probably noticed that the RpcClient inside our `BitcoinClient` is wrapped in an `Arc`. If you’re used to higher-level languages like Python, this might be new to you. While you don’t need to fully understand `Arc` for this workshop, it’s worth digging into a bit more.

`Arc` stands for **Atomic Reference Counting**, and it’s part of Rust’s standard library (`std::sync::Arc`). To see why we use it, let’s zoom out to our Lightning node. Once it’s running, different parts of the node will need to use the `RpcClient` — our connection to Bitcoin — for things like estimating fees, broadcasting transactions, or fetching blockchain data. These tasks often happen at the same time (concurrently), and we need a way to share the `RpcClient` safely across them.

That’s where thread safety comes in. Thread safety means our program can handle multiple tasks (like threads or async operations) accessing shared data without causing problems. Imagine if two tasks tried to use the `RpcClient` at once in a messy way—one updating some internal state while another reads it. Without care, this could lead to a data race, where the data gets corrupted or the program behaves unpredictably.

`Arc` solves this by creating a thread-safe reference to the `RpcClient`. It lets multiple components borrow the same `RpcClient` without duplicating it, and it keeps track of how many parts of the program are using it. When everyone’s done, `Arc` automatically cleans up the `RpcClient`. This way, our node can juggle all its tasks — like fee estimation and transaction broadcasting — without tripping over itself.

### Instantiating Our Bitcoin Interface

Now that we've defined the structure for our `BitcoinClient`, let's start implementing some functionality!

The first function we'll implement is the `new` **constructor**. A constructor is similar to a method, in that they're both functions, but a constructor is a special funtion that initializes a new instance of a type. You can think of this as function as similar to the `__init__` function of a Python Class.

Our `new` constructor will define the RPC endpoint to our Repl's Bitcoin Core and then return an instance of `BitcoinClient`. You can see the overall structure and flow of the function below.

```rust
impl BitcoinClient {
    pub(crate) async fn new(
        host: String, port: u16, rpc_user: String,
        rpc_password: String, network: Network,
    ) -> std::io::Result<Self> {

        // define http endpoint

        // define rpc credentials 

        // create a new RpcClient

        // make an RPC call to Bitcoind to ensure our connection is working properly
        // raise error if we cannot connect

        // create instance of BitcoinClient

        // return BitcoinClient
    }
}
```

## ⚡️ Implement the `new` constructor For Our `BitcoinClient`

For this exercise, we'll implement a `new` constructor for our `BitcoinClient`. This constructor will initialize a new instance with the necessary configuration to communicate with our Bitcoin node. **We'll later pass this instance to various LDK components that need access to the blockchain, fee estimation, and transaction broadcasting functionality**. We haven't created that functionality just yet, but we will soon!

To do this, we'll have to complete the following steps:
1) **Define an HTTP Endpoint**
    - [HttpEndpoint Rust Docs](https://docs.rs/lightning-block-sync/latest/lightning_block_sync/http/struct.HttpEndpoint.html)
2) **Define RPC credentials**
    - Credentials should be a base64 encoding of a user name and password joined by a colon.
3) **Create a new RPC Client**
    - [RpcClient::new Rust Docs](https://docs.rs/lightning-block-sync/latest/lightning_block_sync/rpc/struct.RpcClient.html#method.new)
4) **Make test RPC call**
    - [RpcClient call_method Rust Docs](https://docs.rs/lightning-block-sync/latest/lightning_block_sync/rpc/struct.RpcClient.html#method.call_method)
5) **Return instance of Bitcoin Client**

If you're familiar with Rust, helpful documentation/hints have been provided below each step. If you're not very familiar with Rust, the below helper functions are available to you:


```rust
fn get_http_endpoint(host: &String, port: u16) -> HttpEndpoint {
    // creates HttpEndpoint object with given host and port
}
```

```rust
fn format_rpc_credentials(rpc_user: &String, rpc_password: &String) -> String {
    // creates rpc credentials string in required format
}
```

```rust
fn new_rpc_client(rpc_credentials: &String, http_endpoint: HttpEndpoint) -> RpcClient {
    // creates new rpc client
}
```

```rust
async fn test_rpc_call(bitcoind_rpc_client: &RpcClient) -> std::io::Result<BlockchainInfo> {
    // makes a test "getblockchaininfo" RPC call to Bitcoin Core
}
```
**You should be good-to-go! Try implementing the `new` constructor in ```src/ch2_setup/exercises.rs```**! Click `Run` at the top of the Replit when you're done to see if the test `test ch2_setup::test::test_new_bitcoind ...` passes.
```rust
impl BitcoinClient {
    pub(crate) async fn new(
        host: String, port: u16, rpc_user: String,
        rpc_password: String, network: Network,
    ) -> std::io::Result<Self> {

        // define http endpoint

        // define rpc credentials 

        // create a new RpcClient

        // make an RPC call to Bitcoind to ensure our connection is working properly
        // raise error if we cannot connect

        // create instance of BitcoinClient

        // return BitcoinClient
    }
}
```
