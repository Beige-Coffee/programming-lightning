# What is a mempool?
First and foremost, notice how this section's title is "What is ***a*** mempool?" and *not* "What is ***the*** mempool". This is a small, but significant, difference!

A **memory pool** (mempool) is a node's local storage of unconfirmed Bitcoin transactions. These transactions are either created by us or relayed to us by other nodes, and they are stored in our node's random access memory (RAM). Once these transactions have been included in a block, they are removed from the mempool.

Furthermore, the rules that your node's mempool follows will depend on a few factors, such as which Bitcoin client you're running and how you configure the mempool settings. Remember, the Bitcoin protocol is a set of rules that all *implementations* must follow, but there are multiple implementations. **Bitcoin Core**, a C++ codebase that was originally created by Satoshi, is the most popular implementation. However, other options exist, such as **Bitcoin Knots**, which is a derivative of Bitcoin Core, and **btcd**, which is a Bitcoin implementation written in Go. Since implementations are free to add additional rules that don't break consensus, each implementation may enforce different mempool policies. For example, Bitcoin Knots provides users with extra customization to filter out transactions that contain inscriptions.

Since we're running a Bitcoin Core node in the background of this workbook, we have our own mempool! Go ahead and type the following command in your terminal:

```
bcli getrawmempool
```

Once you run this, you'll see which unconfirmed transactions, if any, your node is aware of.

#### Question: Why do nodes have mempools in the first place? Why don't we just send transactions to miners directly?

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

While it might be more convenient to directly send transactions to miners, this would pose serious privacy concerns. For instance, in this secenario, miners would be able to monitor the IP addresses associated with the node's sending transactions to miners. Not only is this a privacy leak, but it opens the door to Denial of Service attacks.

By leveraging the mempool to monitor transactions peer-to-peer, it's much harder for a minder to know where a transactions originated from. Additionally, it's much easier for a new miner to join the network, as they will be relayed new transactions to mine by default.

Another important reason mempools exist is to create an orderly staging area for transactions ready to be mined. To do this, mempools will employ various policies to ensure that the transactions they store are both valid (do not double-spend) and mineable (ex: not timelocked).

#### Question: Why is a mempool stored in memory and not disk?

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

First and foremost, it should be noted that your node may persist its mempool to disk when it shuts down. This way, it can read those transactions from disk when it reboots. That said, when operating, transactions will be stored in memory for the following reasons - all related to speed and efficiency:
1) **Transactions**: As we'll see shortly, your node will validate new transactions it recieves before adding them to the mempool. Part of this validation process invloves checking to make sure the new transaction does not conflict (ex: double-spend) with an existing transaction in the mempool. This process is made much faster if your node reads these transactions from memory as opposed to disk.
2) **Blocks**: When your node recieves a new block, it must validate the block before passing it on to other nodes. Part of this process involves validating transactions in the block. If a node has these transactions in their mempool and already validated, this process is much faster.
3) **Mining**: It's much faster to build a candidate block to mine if you can retrieve transactions from memory instead of disk.

# What is mempool policy?
So, we've learned that our node has its own mempool where it temporarily stores unconfirmed Bitcoin transactions. Cool! 

#### Question: Should we have any rules when accepting transactions from peers? Are there risks to accepting all transactions without rules?

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

Yes! At its core, a Bitcoin node is a computer with an internet connection to other, anonymous, internet-connected devices. Given that our peers are anonymous, we cannot assume that they will act with good intentions

If a node does not have existing policies when accepting new connections and data, it would be exposed to various Denial of Service (DoS) attacks by peers.

To ensure that they cannot deliberately send you data and transactions that will use all your node's resources and, possibly, crash your node, your node will abide by a set of policies which dictate how to handle incoming data and connections.

</details>

In an effort to mitigate against Denial of Service attacks from peers, a Bitcoin node will enforce a **transaction relay policy**, which includes a set of **validation** and **consensus** rules to apply to unconfirmed transactions.

### Consensus Rules

Consensus policies are the most straight-forward policy rules, as they strictly define what is a valid or invalid use of Bitcoin. These rules hold across the entire network, regardless of which Bitcoin client you use.

For example, one consensus rule is that **the sum of a transaction's input values must be greater than or equal to the sum of the output values**. In other words, you cannot spend bitcoin you don't own.

</p>


<details>
  <summary>⚡️ Consensus Exercise</summary>

Let's get a deeper understanding of how our node will react if we attempt to relay a transaction that breaks consensus.

To start this exercise, go to your **shell** and type the below command. This command will produce a transaction hex, which attempts to spend 5.5M sats from a UTXO that only has 5M sats. This is the same as the example in the image above!

```
cargo run -- mempool -c consensus
```

If you'd like, you can verify that this transaction is attempting to spend 5.5M by running the below command. After running this, look at the **vout** section!

```
decodetx <tx_hex>
```

Now, go ahead and try to relay this transaction to the network by entering the below in the **shell**.

```
sendtx <tx_hex>
```

You should get the below error! This is informing us that the transaction's outputs are greater than its inputs. **Therefore, it won't relay it because we are breaking consensus rules!**

```
bad-txns-in-belowout, value in (0.05) < value out (0.055)
```

</details>

### Standardness Rules

Standardness rules define a set of *additional* rules that nodes apply to **transactions**. These rules are client-specific and *not* required to be universal across the entire Bitcoin network. These rules are often put in place to ensure the network remains healthy and is resistant to Denial of Service attacks.

As an example, **Pay-to-MultiSig** (**P2MS**) is legacy script type that enables you to lock bitcoin to multiple public keys. Nowadays, it's much more common to wrap a P2MS within a script hash (P2SH or P2WSH), which is what we reviewed earlier.

That said, P2MS is only considered **standard** for up to 3 public keys. This means, if you create an output script that locks directly to a 2-of-3 P2MS, nodes will relay this transaction. However, if you increase the number of public keys, this would be considered **non-standard**, so, even though it can be included in a block by a miner, nodes will not relay it.

It's important to notice that we are locking to the script itself - not the hash of the script!

<details>
  <summary>⚡️ Standardness Exercise</summary>

To start this exercise, go to your **shell** and type the below command. This command will produce a transaction hex, which attempts to spend 5 sats from a UTXO that only has 5M sats, and it will lock that output to a 3-of-4 P2MS.

```
cargo run -- mempool -c nonstandard
```

If you'd like, you can verify that this transaction is locking to a 3-of-4 P2MS output, you can run the below command. Make sure to check the **asm** section. You will see `3` `pubkey` `pubkey` `pubkey` `pubkey` `4` `OP_CHECKMULTISIG`.

```
decodetx <tx_hex>
```

Now, go ahead and try to relay this transaction to the network by entering the below in the **shell**.

```
sendtx <tx_hex>
```

You should get the below error! This is informing us that there is an issue with the transaction's scriptpubkey. **Therefore, it won't relay it because we are breaking standardness rules!**

```
error code: -26
error message:
scriptpubkey
```

### Node Policy Rules

Similar to Standardness Rules, **Mempool Policy Rules** define a set of *additional* rules that nodes apply to components within their node, such as their **mempool** or **transaction-relay** functionality. Again, these rules are also client-specific and can vary across Bitcoin clients.

#### Mempool
For example, one Bitcoin Core policy rule is that an unconfirmed mempool transaction can not have more than 25 decendent transactions. This rule is an attempt to find a balance between two large goals of a node's mempool.
1) Relay transactions across the network, helping to serve miners transactions and keep the network healthy. Also, having a robust mempool enables a node to estimate accurate on-chain fees without reliance on a third party!
2) Prevent denial of service attacks. As we mentioned earlier, if

  <img src="./tutorial_images/intro_to_htlc/25_decendants.png" alt="25_decendants" width="70%" height="auto">
</p>

#### Transaction Relay
Similar to standardness rules, which define "standard" or "normal" transaction structures, transaction relay rules empower nodes to decide which transactions to incude in their mempool and relay to others.

One such rule is the **dust output limit**, which dictates what the minimum value of an output should be such that it does not become **economically unspendable**. An economically unspendable output is one that would cost more in fees to spend than the output is worth, making it effectively valueless.

For example, in the image below, the transaction has the following two outputs:
1) 4.9M sats locked to a Pay-To-Witness-Public-Key-Hash output.
2) 100 sats locked to a Pay-To-Witness-Public-Key-Hash output.

The 100 sat output is economically unspendable, as it would cost more (in fees) than 100 sats to spend this output.

</p>

#### Question: Why bother restricting dust outputs at all? Shouldn't it be a user's responsibility to pick output sizes that they can spend later?

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

Unfortunately, dust outputs impact all full-nodes, as they need to be stored in the Unspent Transaction Output Set (UTXO Set). Therefore, dust outputs become a burden on the entire network by increasing storage requirements for full nodes. Additionally, if an attacker could create many 1 sat output transactions, they could spam the network with valid transactions cheaply.

Therefore, Bitcoin implementations, such as Bitcoin Core, enforce a **dust limit** on transaction outputs, depending on the output type. You can find the dust limits below:

- **P2PKH**: 546 sats
- **P2SH-P2WPKH**: 540 sats
- **P2WPKH**: 294 sats
- **P2TR** and **P2WSH**: 330 sats

  <summary>⚡️ Node Policy Exercise</summary>

To start this exercise, go to your **shell** and type the below command. This command will produce a transaction hex that is similar to the above transaction in that it has the following two outputs:
1) 4.9M sats locked to a Pay-To-Witness-Public-Key-Hash output.
2) 100 sats locked to a Pay-To-Witness-Public-Key-Hash output.

```
cargo run -- mempool -c policy
```

If you'd like, you can verify this, you can decode the transaction and check the two outputs in the **vout** section. You'll see one is for `"value": 0.00000100`.

```
decodetx <tx_hex>
```

Now, go ahead and try to relay this transaction to the network by entering the below in the **shell**.

```
sendtx <tx_hex>
```

You should get the below error! This is informing us that at least one output is below the dust limit defined by Bitcoin Core, which we're running in this workbook. **Therefore, our node won't relay the transaction because we are breaking node policy rules!**

```
error code: -26
error message:
dust
```
