# Create Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) Client

Great, we now have the ability to create a new `BitcoindClient` instance, which implements the `BlockSource` using an `RpcClient`. Now, we have to instantiate an SPV client which will periodicall poll our `BlockSource` for the best chain tip and communicate any new (or reorganized) blocks to various LDK components.

## Simplified Payment Verification (SPV)
Before digging into the LDK implementation, let's briefly review the concept behind **Simplified Payment Verification**.

Many Bitcoin applications are designed to run resource-constrained machines such as phones. It' not feasible or desirable for these applications to store a full bitcoin blockchain so that they can monitor and validate transactions. To get around this, they implement SPV and only download block headers, resulting in a 1000x smaller storage requirement compared to the full blockchain.

Our lightning node will leverage a SPV client to periodically fetch block chain headers from our `BlockSource` implementation. Whenever it recieves a new block, it will validate the proof-of-work and pass the block to LDK components that need to be aware of new blocks, such as the `ChannelManger` and `ChainMonitor`.
