# Aliases

The repl comes with a couple aliases that will be useful as we being to program lightning.  Let's take a minute to get familiar and give some of them a try.


## Mine blocks

After broadcasting a transaction we will need blocks to be mined.

ðŸ‘‰ Try mining 6 blocks to make sure our funding in the last step is sufficiently confirmed:

```
mine 6
```

Mining blocks is useful when you need confirmations on any transaction but in this workshop it will be useful when opening and closing lightning channels.

## Broadcast Raw Transaction

ðŸ‘‰ Broadcast a raw transactions to the regtest environment running in the background.

```
sendtx <raw tx hex>
```

## Decode Raw Transaction

ðŸ‘‰ Decode a raw transaction so that it's easy to see the various inputs, outputs, and other transaction information.

```
decodetx <raw tx hex>
```

## Get Transaction

ðŸ‘‰ Retrieve information about a broadcasted transaction.

```
gettx <tx id>
```

## Get UTXO

ðŸ‘‰ Retrieve information about a UTXO. If no information is returned, that UTXO does not exist.

```
getutxo <tx id> <output index>
```
