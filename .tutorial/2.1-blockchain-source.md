# Connecting To The Bitcoin Blockchain

Before we can get to complex Lightning Network functionality, let's begin by anchoring our node to the Bitcoin blockchain. After all, as we learned in the intro section, we'll start our Lightning journey by anchoring a funding transaction in the Bitcoin blockchain.

#### Question: What specific tasks or functions will our Lightning node need to perform when interacting with the Bitcoin blockchain?

    Answer
</summary>

As we just learned, the backbone of Lightning is a fairness protocol. Two parties agree to exchange bitcoin transactions off-chain, but transactions can be published to the chain if a given party needs to enforce the fairness protocol.

There are many answers to this question. Below are a few:
- Broadcasting transactions
  - Channel funding
  - Channel closing
  - Commitment / HTLCs
  - Justice (punishment)
- Monitoring blocks and transactions
  - Identify when funding transaction is mined (with ***x*** confirmations)
  - Spot if channel party attempts to publish an old state
- Fee Estimation
  - Via Bitcoin RPC `getmempoolinfo`

## LDK Blockchain Interfaces

When it comes to communicating with the Bitcoin Blockchain, LDK will need to perform a variety of operations such as:
- Fetching Blockchain Data
- Broadcasting Transactions
- Estimating Fees

Within LDK, we can think of each of these tasks as an **interface** - called a "trait" in Rust. Within software engineering, an interface **defines a set of methods that a structure must implement**. *The structure does not implement these methods itself*. In other words, LDK will provide a template structure for each of the above functionalities, and it is up to the developer to decide how to implement the functionality.

The benefit of this is that is provides a lot of flexibility and customization to the developer. For instance, the developer can decide where they would like to source blockchain data from - a full node, esplora server, etc. Over the next few exercises, we'll see just how great this added flexibiltiy can be.

Now that we've reviewed some of the functionality we're going to need to implement, let's see which LDK interfaces are available to us.

- **BlockSource**: This trait defines methods to retriev block and header data from a blockchain source. It's up to the developer to specify where this data is sourced from (full node, esplora server, etc.).
- **BroadcasterInterface**: This trait defines a method for broadcasting transactions. Since LDK does not know, by default, how LDK is interacting with the blockchain, the developer must implement their prefered method of broadcasting transactions (ex: RPC call to full node, third party API call, etc.).
- **FeeEstimator**: This trait defines a method for estimating bitcoin feerates. It takes a `ConfirmationTarget` as an input, which well discuss in more detail later. For now, it's sufficient to know that this defines various priorities for which we'd like a transaction to be confirmed. These are defined by LDK, and our implementation of the `FeeEstimator` must provide a feerate for each `ConfirmationTarget`.

## Fetching Blockchain Data

For this portion of the workshop, we'll focus on configuring LDK so that it can retrieve and process blockchain data, such as new blocks and/or confirmed transactions. This information is neccessary so that we can successfuly maintain channel states and monitor for relevant on-chain activity.

Below is a diagram depicting a few imporant data types that our node will need to be able to retrieve from the Bitcoin blockchain.

1) Block Height
2) Block Data (Header + Transactions)
3) Block Hash

</p>

### BlockSource

To aid in retrieving this information, LDK provides a `BlockSource` interface with the required methods that must be implemented by the developer.

```rust
pub trait BlockSource: Sync + Send {
    // Required methods - need to be implemented by the user
    fn get_header<'a>(
        &'a self,
        header_hash: &'a BlockHash,
        height_hint: Option<u32>,
    ) -> AsyncBlockSourceResult<'a, BlockHeaderData>;

    fn get_block<'a>(
        &'a self,
        header_hash: &'a BlockHash,
    ) -> AsyncBlockSourceResult<'a, BlockData>;

    fn get_best_block<'a>(
        &'a self,
    ) -> AsyncBlockSourceResult<'_, (BlockHash, Option<u32>)>;
}
```
As mentioned above, developers have the option to build a custom blockchain interface. If they choose to do this, they will need to manually parse blockchain data and notify LDK components such as `ChannelManager` and `ChainMonitor` that new blocks have been connected or disconnected.

To assist with this, LDK provides a sample implementation of the `BlockSource` in `lightning-block-sync` utility. This implemenation retrieves Bitcoin data by querying Bitcoin Core's JSON RPC interface. Since we have a Bitcoin Core node running in the background of this Repl, we'll be using the implementation provided by LDK.


### Defining BitcoindClient

Since we’ll be implementing multiple interfaces that interact with Bitcoin Core, we’ll create a `BitcoindClient` structure to consolidate these interactions.

In Rust, a struct is a custom data type that groups together related data and functionality. Our `BitcoindClient` will act as the central hub for all interactions with Bitcoin Core, implementing the necessary traits like `BlockSource`, `FeeEstimator`, and `BroadcasterInterface`. This design keeps our code modular, maintainable, and aligned with LDK’s architecture.

<p align="center" style="width: 50%; max-width: 300px;">
  <img src="./tutorial_images/node_setup/bitcoindclient.png" alt="bitcoindclient" width="75%" height="auto">
</p>

We’ll start by defining our `BitcoindClient` struct. This struct will serve as the foundation for our custom Bitcoin Core client. In addition to implementing the interfaces we discussed (`BlockSource`, `FeeEstimator`, and `BroadcasterInterface`), it will also store important information related to our connection to Bitcoin Core, such as network configuration and credentials.

```rust
pub struct BitcoindClient {
    pub(crate) bitcoind_rpc_client: Arc<RpcClient>,
    network: Network,
    host: String,
    port: u16,
    rpc_user: String,
    rpc_password: String
}
```
We can now implement all the required methods form the `BlockSource` trait by delegating to the corresponding methods in our `bitcoind_rpc_client`.

## ⚡️ Implement `BlockSource` For Our `BitcoindClient`
Complete the implementation of `BlockSource` for `BitcoindClient`. You'll need to implement:

1. `get_header`: Fetches a block header by its hash
2. `get_block`: Fetches a complete block by its hash
3. `get_best_block`: Fetches information about the most recent block

### Available Methods

You have access to `self.bitcoind_rpc_client` which provides these RPC methods:
- `get_header(header_hash, height_hint)` - Returns block header data
- `get_block(header_hash)` - Returns full block data
- `get_best_block()` - Returns the latest block info

Below is some code to get you started. Note, for technical reasons outside the scope of this workshop, you'll want to wrap your ```self.bitcoind_rpc_client.``` statements in `Box::pin(async move {  })`.
```rust
impl BlockSource for BitcoindClient {
    fn get_header<'a>(
        &'a self, header_hash: &'a BlockHash, height_hint: Option<u32>,
    ) -> AsyncBlockSourceResult<'a, BlockHeaderData> {
        // 1. Use self.bitcoind_rpc_client.get_header
        // 2. Wrap the async call with Box::pin(async move { ... })
    }

    fn get_block<'a>(
        &'a self, header_hash: &'a BlockHash,
    ) -> AsyncBlockSourceResult<'a, BlockData> {
        // 1. Use self.bitcoind_rpc_client.get_block
        // 2. Wrap the async call with Box::pin(async move { ... })

    }

    fn get_best_block<'a>(&'a self) -> AsyncBlockSourceResult<(BlockHash, Option<u32>)> {
        // 1. Use self.bitcoind_rpc_client.get_best_block
        // 2. Wrap the async call with Box::pin(async move { ... })
    }
}
```
